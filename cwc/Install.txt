Redistribute JDK?

According to my reading, yes, but with some caveats:

    -You must redistribute the entire Oracle JDK, OR the entire JRE with just "The javac bytecode compiler" which includes tools.jar; that redistribution is allowed to be "bundled" with your app.
    
	-Redistributed JDK or JRE must be "complete and unmodified" (minus a couple sections about things you can add and/or subtract).
	
    -Can never redistribute beta versions.
	
    -You comply with the other general terms covered in the redistribution section of the license (my source for this entire answer).
